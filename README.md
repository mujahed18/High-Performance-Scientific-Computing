## Title:
Comparisons of methods to solve differential equations with serial and parallel implementation

## Proof:
1. Time required for serial and parallel implementation of codes is given in the serial code results and parallel code results respectively.
2. RMS error is calculated and given in the same tables.
3. So, Accuracy = (1 - RMS Error)*100 and ;
4. Accuracy of all methods is beyond 99%
5. Speed up = (Time for serial code/Time for parallel code)
6. Speed up for all the methods is beyond 4 times.
