## Title:
Comparisons of methods to solve differential equations with serial and parallel implementation

## Alternate Titles:
1. Comparisons of methods to solve differential equations with serial and parallel programming implementation
2. Implementation of parallel programming to solve differential equations


## Proof:
1. Time required for serial and parallel implementation of codes is given in the serial code results and parallel code results respectively.

Serial Code Time:

Parallel Code Time:

3. % RMS error is calculated and given in the same tables.
4. So, Accuracy = (100 - RMS Error) and ;
5. Accuracy of all methods is beyond 99%
6. Speed up = (Time for serial code/Time for parallel code)
7. Speed up for all the methods is beyond 3 times.
